# Basic_Python_Part_1
This repository is designed to share with you some exercises that I did to learn the basics of Python commands and syntax.

Small collection of exercises and notebooks focused on Python fundamentals for data analysis.

This folder is part 1 of 2 repositories that contain a set of basic Python exercises designed to strengthen your programming fundamentals. Some of the topics we will cover include conditional statements (if, elif, else), integers, lists, and more. Each exercise is designed to help you understand core concepts through practical examples, making it easier to apply them in data analysis and other projects.
